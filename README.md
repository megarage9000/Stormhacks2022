# ViewParty

  A social game where you can share videos with 
your friends as if you were hanging out! 
ViewParty is inspired by the likes of [Garry's Mod Cinema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gceedIPSAjc) 
and virtual concerts, which both incorporate online, 
interactive solutions for entertainment and sociable 
environments in a remote environment.
